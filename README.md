# Introduction
This repository contains the logos for Open Liberty.  It is divided into three sections:
- [logomark](/logomark/) - Contains the Open Liberty UFOs (also commonly known as 'logo').
- [wordmark](/wordmark/) - Contains the type "Open Liberty" (also commonly known as 'logotype').
- [combomark](/combomark/) - Contains a combination of the logomark (UFO) and wordmark ("Open Liberty") in a single logo (also commonly known as 'combination mark').

## Guidance & Notes
Each root mark directory is further divided into folders that seperate the content by file type: png and svg.  
Further, each file follows the following basic naming scheme [description]\_[color]\_[size]\_[background] (if background is not specified, it is transparent/clear).  

Images/graphics in sub-folders of the content folders should only be used where necessary & appropriate.  For example, the [Open Liberty Square Logomark](logomark/png/square/OL_logomark_square_392.png) should only be used where a square logo is necessary and the regular rectengular logo would not fit appropriately, for example, as used on [twitter](https://twitter.com/openlibertyio).

## Terms of Use
These logos can only be used if you follow the terms of the [license](/LICENSE.adoc).
